  %h2 Enrollment
  %p Wind in the Willows offers two half day Preschool programs: Morning and Afternoon, as well as a Transitional Kindergarten. Preschoolers may attend 3, 4 or 5 days a week, while our TK is 5 days a week. All programs are intentionally kept small to allow the teachers to get to know each child well, and to provide a social environment that isn't overwhelming. Our teacher to child ratio is 1:6. A limited amount of tuition assistance is available.
  %p Our group is composed of children aged 2.9 to 5 years old. In the interests of the child, we request that mixed-age siblings attend separate sessions; however, one day of overlap is obviously necessary. Twins are allowed to be in the same program.
